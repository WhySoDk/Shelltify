## How to use
You see that .env? go to Spotify's dev page then create a new project. Now you should have those keys, plug it in, and run main.py.

(you could use PyInstaller to build an executable, I won't publish mine tho, as it is linked to my Spotify account)

## Note
Speaking of which, Why wouldn't I design the program to allow it to take Spotify's key as input, I mean It started as a fun private project after all. 

Good luck running my code then, you stranger who stumbles upon my repo.
